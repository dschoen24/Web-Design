**Web Design â€“ Web Visualization**

**Background:**
Taking what I have learned from HTML and CSS, I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I have created from my Python API project on weather data.
In building this dashboard, I created the following consisting of a total of 7 pages:

-	A Landing Page
o	An Explanation of my project
o	A Link to each visualization page (4 total) with a sidebar containing preview images of each plot which will take you directly to that specific visualization page once clicked
(The HTML for this page can be found here: https://github.com/dschoen24/Web-Design-Challenge/tree/main/WebVisualizations/index.html)
