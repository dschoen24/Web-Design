**Web Design – Web Visualization**

**Background:**
Taking what I have learned from HTML and CSS, I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I have created from my Python API project on weather data.
In building this dashboard, I created the following consisting of a total of 7 pages:

  -	A Landing Page

    o	An Explanation of my project

    o	A Link to each visualization page (4 total) with a sidebar containing preview images of each plot which will take you directly to that specific                 visualization page once clicked
    
(The HTML for this page can be found here: https://github.com/dschoen24/Web-Design-Challenge/tree/main/WebVisualizations/index.html)

  -	Four Visualization Pages, each with:

    o	A descriptive title and heading tag

    o	The Scatter Plot/Visualization itself for the selected comparison

    o	A Paragraph describing the scatter plot and its significance

       	Page for Latitude vs. Temperature Scatter Plot

       	Page for Latitude vs. Humidity Scatter Plot

       	Page for Latitude vs. Cloudiness Scatter Plot

       	Page for Latitude vs. Wind Speed Scatter Plot

(The HTMLs for these pages can be found here:
